								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									Following the evolution of desktops, mobile architectures 
									are currently witnessing growth of processing power and 
									complexity with the addition of different processing units 
									like multi-core CPUs and GPUs. To facilitate programming 
									and coordinating resource usage in these heterogeneous 
									architectures, we present <b>ParallelME</b>, a <b>Parallel</b> 
									<b>M</b>obile <b>E</b>ngine designed to explore heterogeneity 
									in mobile computing architectures. ParallelME provides a 
									high-level library with a friendly programming language 
									abstraction for developers, facilitating the programming 
									of operations that can be translated into low-level 
									parallel tasks. Additionally, these tasks are coordinated 
									by a proposed run-time framework, which is responsible for 
									scheduling and controlling the execution on the low-level 
									platform.
								</p>
							
								<h2>Programming Abstraction</h2>
								<p>
									ParallelME programming abstraction was inspired by ideas 
									found on the Scala collection library, which is a library 
									consisted of a set of different data structures with native 
									support for parallel processing. The goal for ParallelME 
									was to create a similar data-structure oriented library 
									that could be used to produce parallel code with minimum 
									effort by its user. In ParallelME, this set of data structures 
									is called User Library..
								</p>
							
								<h2>Source-to-Source Compiler</h2>		
								<p>
									ParallelME source-to-source compiler was developed with 
									the incorporation of ANTLR, a powerful parser generator 
									widely used to build languages, tools and frameworks. We 
									used an ANTLR Java grammar to create a parser that was 
									used to build and walk a parse tree, being 
									the basis for ParallelME compiler. It takes as 
									an input Java code written with ParallelME user-library 
									and translates it into C code compatible with RenderScript 
									and ParallelME run-time. Besides that, the compiler also 
									integrates the translated code in the high-performance 
									run-times with the Java original source, creating a 
									mechanism for dinamically choosing RenderScript or the
									OpenCL-based ParallelME run-time, making the framework
									compatible with all recent Android versions.
								</p>
							
								<h2>Run-time</h2>
								<p>
									The run-time component of ParallelME is responsible for 
									coordinating in an efficient way all processing units 
									available in the mobile architecture. It organizes and manages 
									low level tasks generated by ParallelME compiler from 
									code expressed in ParallelME user-library. 
									It was implemented in C++ and integrated with Android through 
									the NDK toolkit.
