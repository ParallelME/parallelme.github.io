				<b>ParalleME Overview</b>
				<br>Following the evolution of desktops, mobile architectures 
				are currently witnessing growth of processing power and 
				complexity with the addition of different processing units 
				like multi-core CPUs and GPUs. To facilitate programming 
				and coordinating resource usage in these hybrid device 
				architectures, we present <b>ParalleME</b> , <b>Paralle</b> 
				<b>M</b>obile <b>E</b>ngine designed to explore heterogeneity 
				in mobile computing architectures. ParallelME provides a 
				high-level library with a friendly programming language 
				abstraction for developers, facilitating the programming 
				of operations that can be translated into low-level 
				parallel tasks. Additionally, these tasks are coordinated 
				by a proposed run-time framework, which is responsible for 
				scheduling and controlling the execution on the low-level 
				platform.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Language Abstraction</h2>
			<p>
				ParallelME programming abstraction was inspired by ideas 
				found on the Scala collection library, which is a library 
				consisted of a set of different data structures with native 
				support for parallel processing. The goal for ParallelME 
				was to create a similar data-structure oriented library 
				that could be used to produce parallel code with minimum 
				effort by its user. In ParallelME, this set of data structures 
				is called User Library..
			</p>
		
			<h2>Source-to-Source Compiler</h2>		
			<p>
				ParallelME source-to-source compiler was developed with 
				the incorporation of ANTLR, a powerful parser generator 
				widely used to build languages, tools and frameworks. We 
				used an ANTLR Java grammar to create a parser that was 
				used to build and walk a parse tree, which by its turn was 
				the basis for ParallelME compiler. Our compiler takes as 
				an input Java code written by the user with the user library 
				and translates it into C code compatible with RenderScript 
				or OpenCL frameworks, depending on the chosen run-time. 
				Besides that, the compiler also integrates the translated 
				code with the Java application performing modifications 
				to the original user code to support the proposed run-time 
				environment.
			</p>
		
			<h2>Run-time</h2>
			<p>
				The run-time component of ParallelME is responsible for 
				coordinating in an efficient way all processing units 
				available in a mobile architecture. It organizes and manages 
				low level tasks generated by the Compiler component, from 
				definitions expressed by developers in Programming Abstraction. 
				The implementation is in C++ and was inserted in the Android 
				system using the NDK toolkit
